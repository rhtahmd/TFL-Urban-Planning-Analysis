# TFL-Urban-Planning-Analysis

# Introduction

In this project, the goal is to analyze transportation data from Transport for London (TFL) to gain insights into urban planning. The dataset, sourced from [Data Source], consists of [description of the dataset], including information about start stations, end stations, journey duration, and travel card types.

# Questions

What are the busiest stations in the TFL network?

How does the journey duration vary across different subsystems?

Are there any specific travel card types that are predominantly used?

How does the number of journeys vary across different days of the week?

# Dataset Description
The dataset obtained from [Data Source] contains information about TFL journeys. It includes the following attributes:

StartStn: The start station of the journey.

EndStation: The end station of the journey.

JourneyDuration: The duration of the journey in minutes.

TravelCardType: The type of travel card used for the journey.

# Tools and Packages

To conduct the analysis, the following tools and packages were utilized:

Python: The primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas and Numpy: For data manipulation and analysis.

SQLite: For querying the dataset using SQL.

Power BI: For advanced data visualization and analysis.

# Methodology
Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset was cleaned and prepared using Pandas to ensure data consistency and remove any unnecessary information.

SQL Querying: SQL queries were executed using SQLite to retrieve relevant information from the dataset. Queries were designed to analyze the busiest stations, journey durations, travel card types, and journey counts across different days of the week.

Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to create visualizations, such as bar plots and line charts, to present the findings from the analysis. Power BI was also employed for advanced visualizations and interactive dashboards.

# Results and Discussion
The analysis revealed the following key findings:

Busiest Stations: The top 50 busiest stations were identified, with Oxford Circus, Victoria, and London Bridge being the most frequently used stations.

Journey Duration by Subsystem: The average journey duration was calculated for different subsystems, such as DLR/LRC, NR/DLR, LUL/NR/DLR, etc. The results indicated variations in journey duration across different subsystems.

Travel Card Types: The distribution of travel card types was analyzed, revealing the most commonly used types among commuters.

Journeys by Day of the Week: The analysis showcased the number of journeys on each day of the week, highlighting any patterns or trends.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this analysis of TFL transportation data provided insights into the busiest stations, journey durations, travel card types, and journey counts across different days of the week. These findings can be valuable for urban planning purposes, enabling policymakers and transportation authorities to optimize infrastructure and services based on demand and usage patterns.
